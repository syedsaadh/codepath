- âœ… Mark problems as solved/unsolved

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codehub.git
   cd codehub
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access**: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Solutions Organization

Create a `solutions` directory in your local workspace with the following structure:

```
solutions/
â”œâ”€â”€ javascript/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.js
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem-2/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solution.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ react/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.jsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem-2/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solution.jsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ node/
    â””â”€â”€ problem-1/
        â”œâ”€â”€ solution.js
        â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Solution Structure Guidelines

1. **Problem Directory**:
   - Name format: `problem-{id}` (matches the problem ID shown in the app)
   - Example: `problem-1`, `problem-2`

2. **Solution Files**:
   - Main solution file (e.g., `solution.js`, `solution.jsx`)
   - Supporting files (if needed)
   - `README.md` with:
     - Problem description
     - Your approach
     - Time/Space complexity
     - Learning points

3. **Technology-Specific Organization**:
   - React problems: Include component files
   - Node.js problems: Include necessary modules
   - Full-stack problems: Separate frontend/backend directories

Example Problem Solution README:
```markdown
# Problem 1: Component State Management

## Problem Description
Implement a counter component with increment/decrement functionality...

## Approach
Used useState hook for state management...

## Solution Overview
- Created Counter component
- Implemented increment/decrement functions
- Added error handling for limits

## Learning Points
- Better understanding of React state
- Learned about component lifecycle
- Practiced error boundary implementation
```

## Learning Path Structure
